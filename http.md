<u>REST (Representational State Transfer)</u><br>
REST is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications, that is primarily used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service based on REST is called a **RESTful service (or RESTful Web Service)**. 
Every system uses resources. These resources can be pictures, video files, Web pages, business information, or anything that can be represented in a computer-based system. The purpose of a service is to provide a window to its clients so that they can access these resources. Service architects and developers want this service to be easy to implement, maintainable, extensible, and scalable. A RESTful design promises that and more. In general, RESTful services should have following properties and features:<br>
-Representations<br>
-Messages<br>
-URIs<br>
-Uniform interface<br>
-Stateless<br>
-Links between resources
